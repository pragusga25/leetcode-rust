# LeetCode Solutions in Rust

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository, where I share my solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in Rust programming language.

## About

LeetCode is a platform for practicing algorithms and data structures through various coding challenges. This repository contains my personal solutions to these challenges, all implemented in Rust.

## Why Rust?

Rust is a powerful systems programming language known for its performance, memory safety, and concurrency features. It's increasingly becoming popular among developers for its expressive syntax and strong type system. I chose Rust for solving LeetCode problems because of its efficiency, safety, and the opportunity to deepen my understanding of the language.

## Solutions

Each problem's solution is organized into its own file within the `src` directory, following a naming convention that includes the problem's title or number. Each solution includes the problem statement as comments, along with a Rust implementation. Additionally, I provide unit tests to validate the correctness of each solution.

Feel free to explore the solutions, learn from them, and provide feedback or suggestions for improvements.

## Contribution

If you have a better or more efficient solution, or if you spot any issues with the existing solutions, I welcome contributions! Simply fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Let's learn and grow together by solving these interesting problems!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
